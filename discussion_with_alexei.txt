Phenomenology

mass of m_h directly related to mu kappa/lambda (Fig 1)
single plot: merge h_1 and h_2

"unphysical region" -> bold font: Sasha, find a better word

Fig 2 and 4 side-by-side

Fig 3 (branching fractions) goes to a later section

Fig 5-a: a_1 singlet fraction versus mu kappa/lambda, array-join it to the top of 5-b

Fig 6: probably excessive, keep it for now
add Gamma(h1 -> WW*)

B. Production and decay rates (first we discussed the model, now how
would we find it experimentally?)

Production rates before decays

Branching of a_1 -> mu mu

Fig 7 is horrific in B&W, require low m_a as an additional two plots
(four plots total, we'll kill some of them)

Fig 10: "(pb, 14 TeV)"


-----------------------------------------

1. low m_a region not explored much
2. we find the region corresponding to low m_a
3. select m_a < 3.55 GeV
4. explain two possible scenarios: large Br(h -> aa), small Br(h -> aa)
5. explain WMAP consistent
6. searches at colliders: production rates at LEP, Tevatron, and LHC

branching fractions before production

Fig 5 (Br(a -> mu mu)) should come after h_1 plots

Fig 7 (Br(h -> aa)) should also be earlier

Fig 10 (hadron collider exclusion): Tevatron open circles (and rough curve), LEP open circles
one plot with WMAP, one without

Fig 8, 9, 11, 14 should just go      DONE
