\begin{abstract}
We explore the potential of Large Hadron Collider to observe  $h_1\to
a_1a_1\to 4\mu$ signal from the lightest lightest scalar Higgs boson
($h_1$) decaying into two  lightest pseudoscalar Higgs bosons($a_1$) 
followed by their decays into 4 muons within the Next-to-Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM).
The signature under study allows to cover the  NMSSM parameter space
with  $M_{a_1}$ below 3.5 GeV and large $Br(h_1\to a_1 a_1)$ 
which has not been studied previously. In case of  such a scenario,
the suggested strategy of the observation of 
$4\mu$ signal with the respective background suppression
would provide a unique way to discover
the lightest scalar NMSSM Higgs boson.

\section{Introduction}

The next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM)
\cite{Nilles:1982dy,Frere:1983ag,Ellis:1988er,%
Drees:1988fc,Ellwanger:1993hn,Ellwanger:1993xa,%
Elliott:1993bs,Pandita:1993tg,Ellwanger:1995ru,%
King:1995vk,Franke:1995tc,Ellwanger:1996gw,Miller:2003ay}
is extended by one singlet superfield in addition to the particle content
of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM)
and due to this design 
has several new attractive features as compared to MSSM.
First  of all, NMSSM elegantly solves so called $\mu$-problem~\cite{mu-problem}:
the scale of the $\mu$-parameter is automatically generated 
at the electroweak or SUSY  scale when the singlet Higgs acquires 
a vacuum expectation value.
On the other hand NMSSM can solve fine-tuning and little hierarchy problems
of MSSM~\cite{Dermisek:2005ar}.
The upper mass limit on the lightest  CP-even
Higgs boson in NMSSM is larger than in MSSM and since more
parameter space survives LEP II bounds from the Higgs search,  NMSSM
is less fine-tuned.
On the other hand  there is additional mechanism for the reduction of
fine-tuning since 
LEP II bounds from the Higgs search can be partly avoided if the
branching of  $h_1\to a_1 a_1$ decay is significant ($h_1$ and
$a_1$ stands for the lightest   CP-even  and CP-odd Higgs bosons respectively).
This decay channel of $h_1$ diminishes the branching ratios for
conventional modes used in direct Higgs  searches and largely softens
direct Higgs boson mass limits from LEP. 

One should stress that due to the extended scalar sector (in comparison to MSSM)
NMSSM offers richer Higgs collider phenomenology
\cite{nmssm-ph1,nmssm-ph2,%
nmssm-ph2b,nmssm-ph3,nmssm-ph4,%
nmssm-ph5,nmssm-ph6,nmssm-ph6a,nmssm-ph7}
as well as richer  cosmological Dark Matter implications 
related to the presence of the fifth  neutralino (``singlino"),
relic density for  which can be achieved to be correct one~\cite{nmssm-dm}.

The collider phenomenology of the Higgs sector of the NMSSM
is very interesting in several aspects, therefore a short historical 
introduction is in  order.
In \cite{nmssm-ph2} the first attempt to establish `no-lose' theorem for NMSSM
has been done. This theorem states that LHC has a potential to discover at least one
NMSSM Higgs boson in the conventional mode given that Higgs-to-Higgs decay modes 
are not important. However the point is that  Higgs-to-Higgs decay modes
can be important as has been shown and studied later on
in analysis devoted to re-establishing   of `no-lose' 
theorem~\cite{nmssm-ph2b,nmssm-ph3,nmssm-ph4,nmssm-ph5,nmssm-ph6,nmssm-ph6a,nmssm-ph7}
for the case when  $h_1\to a_1 a_1$ decay is significant
and $a_1$ is light. So far, the case of the lightest $a_1$  was explored 
for $m_{a_1}$ below $2b$-quark threshold but above $2\tau$ one,
$2m_\tau <m_{a_1}<2m_b$, establishing the scope of
the $4\tau$ channel in Higgs-strahlung and Vector Boson Fusion
for the NMSSM No-Lose Theorem at the LHC~\cite{nmssm-ph7}.
Theses analysis  require a substantial integrated luminosity (10-100 fb$^{-1}$)
and quite challenging analysis in the technical sense.


In this paper we explore the  mass region of  $a_1$ 
with the mass below $2\tau$ threshold: $m_{a_1}<2m_\tau$.
In this case, which has not been studied previously, we 
explore $h_1 \to a_1a_1 \to \mu \mu \mu \mu$ signature.
Unlike searches for $4\tau$ signature,
the measurement of invariant mass of muon pair provides a 
direct estimate of $m_{a_1}$ which defines a clear set of the kinematical
cuts for the background suppression. 
Further, this
channel is essentially free of backgrounds and therefore allows to use
direct gluon fusion production combined with  $b\bar{b}$ fusion production
instead of subdominant  vector boson fusion or associate 
Higgs production processes used in case of $4\tau$ signature to to suppress large QCD
backgrounds.

We demonstrate that the analysis in
the four muon mode has excellent sensitivity for Lightest CP-even NMSSM Higgs boson
and can be performed with just  a handful of first LHC data and requires 
very little in terms of detector performance  except reasonably robust tracking 
for muons and well functioning muon system. To make 
this a realistic analysis, we use parameters of the CMS experiment in designing
selections and estimating background contributions.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In Section II we study the NMSSM parameters space 
for which $m_{a_1}<2m_\mu$ case of our study is realized.
In Section III we perform signal versus background analysis
and present our final  results in Section IV.
In Section V we draw our conclusions.

\section{NMSSM Parameter Space and Signal production rates}

\subsection{The model and its parameters}
In our study we consider the simplest version of the NMSSM
\cite{Nilles:1982dy,Frere:1983ag,Ellis:1988er,%
Drees:1988fc,Ellwanger:1993hn,Ellwanger:1993xa,%
Elliott:1993bs,Pandita:1993tg,Ellwanger:1995ru,%
King:1995vk,Franke:1995tc,Ellwanger:1996gw},
in which the $\mu\widehat{H_1}\widehat{H_2}$ term of the 
MSSM superpotential is replaced by
\begin{equation}
\lambda  \widehat{S} \widehat{H}_1 \widehat{H}_2 + \frac{\kappa}{3}  \widehat{S}^3 \mbox{.}
\label{eq:superpot} 
\end{equation}
This makes the superpotential scale invariant.  In general, we have five
soft braking terms; in the "non-universal" case,
\begin{equation}
  m_{H_1}^2 H_1^2 + m_{H_2}^2 H_2^2  + m_{S}^2 S^2 
+ \lambda A_\lambda H_1 H_2 S +  \frac{\kappa}{3} A_\kappa S^3.
\label{eq:soft} 
\end{equation}
In the above equations, capital letters with tildes denote superfields
while symbols without tildes denote the scalar component of the respective
superfield.

Soft breaking parameters
$m_{H_1}^2$ , $m_{H_2}^2$  and $m_{S}^2$ 
from Eq.~\ref{eq:soft} can  be replaced by
$M_Z$, the ratio  of the doublet Higgs vacuum expectation values (VEVs) $\tan\beta$,
and $\mu = \lambda \langle S \rangle$
(where $\langle S \rangle$ denotes the VEV of the singlet Higgs field)
through the three minimization equations of the Higgs potential.
Assuming that the Higgs sector is CP conserving,
the NMSSM Higgs sector at the Electro-Weak (EW) scale is uniquely defined
by 14 parameters:
$\tan\beta$,
the trilinear couplings in the superpotential $\lambda$ and $\kappa$, the
corresponding soft SUSY breaking parameters $A_\lambda$ and $A_\kappa$,
the effective $\mu$ parameter $\mu = \lambda \langle S \rangle$,
the gaugino mass parameters $M_1$, $M_2$ and $M_3$,
the squark and slepton trilinear couplings
$A_{t}$,  $A_{b}$ and  $A_\tau$,
and the squark and slepton mass parameters $M_{f_L}$ and $M_{f_R}$.
For simplicity, we assume here the
universality within 3 generations for the last two parameters, leaving
only 6 parameters.

\subsection{The light-$m_a$ region of the NMSSM}

To present our region of interest, $m_a < 2m_\tau$, we scan the NMSSM
parameter space using the NMSSMTools
package~\cite{nmssmtools1,nmssmtools2,nmssmtools3}, applying all known
phenomenological and experimental constraints except the following:
the cosmological dark matter measured by WMAP-5~[ref], direct
$p\bar{p} \to h_1 \to aa \to 4\mu$ and $2\mu$, $2\tau$ searches by the
Tevatron~[ref], direct $e^+e^- \to Zh_1$, $h_1 \to aa$ searches by
LEP~[ref], and direct $\Upsilon \to \gamma a$ searches by CLEO~[ref]
and BaBar~[ref].  These important constraints will be applied
explicitly to our region of interest in a later section.

We scanned the NMSSM parameter space uniformly in the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item 100~GeV $<$ $\mu$ $<$ 1000~GeV
\item 0 $<$ $\lambda$ $<$ 1
\item 1.5 $<$ $\tan\beta$ $<$ 50
\item $-$1~TeV $<$ $A_\lambda$ $<$ 5~TeV
\item 0 $<$ $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ $<$ 120~GeV
\item $-$3~GeV $<$ $A_\kappa - (\mbox{30~GeV})\lambda^2$ $<$ 0.1~GeV.
\end{itemize}
The first four are conventional, broad ranges over the probable values
of $\mu$, $\lambda$, $\tan\beta$, and $A_\lambda$.  The fifth
requirement, on the combination $\mu\kappa/\lambda$, evenly divides
the scanned space into a region with a light, approximately singlet
$h_1$ that couples highly to $aa$, but weakly to Standard Model
particles, and a region with a conventional heavy Higgs, as we will
later see.  The last requirement, on the combination $A_\kappa -
(\mbox{30~GeV})\lambda^2$, selects a region with a roughly uniform
distribution of light $m_a$ between 0 and 30~GeV, which will also be
presented below.  The phenomenology of $pp \to h_1 \to
a_1a_1 \to 4\mu$ is determined almost exclusively by the
$\mu\kappa/\lambda$ ratio, $\lambda$, and $A_\kappa$.  Varying
$\tan\beta$ and $A_\lambda$ has negligible effect on the masses,
branching fractions, and production cross-section.

The mass of the lightest two CP-even Higgs bosons are related to
$\mu\kappa/\lambda$ in a simple way: for one of the two, $m_h \approx
2 \mu\kappa/\lambda$, while for the other, $m_h \approx 125$~GeV, with
labels $h_1$ ($h_2$) designating the (second) lightest.  These
relationships are more precise when $\lambda \ll 1$, as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:hmass_mukoverl}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=0.7\linewidth, angle=90]{plots/newbranching/smass12_vs_mkovel.eps}
\caption{Lightest ($h_1$) and second-lightest ($h_2$)
  CP-even Higgs masses as a function of $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ and
  $\lambda$.  The density of generated points surviving constraints is
  shown in the color scale, and the lines are average mass as a function of 
  $\mu\kappa/\lambda$, with $\lambda < 0.01$ (dashed line) and 
  $\lambda > 0.1$ (dotted line). \label{fig:hmass_mukoverl}}
\end{figure}

The mass of the lightest CP-odd Higgs is related to $A_\kappa$,
$\lambda$, and $\mu\kappa/\lambda$.  In the $A_\kappa$-$\lambda$
plane, $m_a$ grows with distance from a $A_\kappa =
(\mbox{30~GeV})\lambda^2$ line, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:amass2}-a.
The light $m_a$ region of our interest is therefore $A_\kappa -
(\mbox{30~GeV})\lambda^2 \gtrsim 0$.  Below zero, {\bf assumption X
  fails, making this an unphysical region.  Sasha: what happens in
  this region?  What word can we use to substitute ``unphysical?''}
In Fig.~\ref{fig:amass2}-b, we see that $m_a$ is also a function of
$\mu\kappa/\lambda$.  The full dependence is approximately described
by $\left[A_\kappa - (\mbox{30~GeV}) \lambda^2\right] \, \cdot \,
\frac{\mu\kappa}{\lambda} \approx -(0.58 \, m_a)^2$ (true for 80\% of
sampled points with at least 10\% accuracy).

\begin{figure}

\caption{Left: mass of the CP-odd Higgs ($m_a$) as a function of 
  $A_\kappa$ and $\lambda$.  The color scale is the average mass in

  Right: $m_a$ versus the unfolded parabolic curve, $A_\kappa -

  illustrated by curves with different selections on
  $\mu\kappa/\lambda$.  The upper edge is an artifact of our
  $\mu\kappa/\lambda < 120$~GeV scan boundary. \label{fig:amass2}}
\end{figure}

The couplings of $h_1$ and $a$, to each other and to Standard Model
particles, are determined by their singlet fractions.  Over the whole
region of interest, $a$ is almost exactly a pure singlet ($|zzz - 1|
\lesssim 10^{-5}$), while the singlet fraction of $h_1$ depends on
$\mu\kappa/\lambda$ and $\lambda$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:singlet}).  {\bf What
  is $zzz$?  These values are $SCOMP(1,3)^2$ and $PCOMP(1,2)^2$; what
  symbol will we use for this in the text?}  If $\mu\kappa/\lambda
\lesssim 60$~GeV, $h_1$ is approximately singlet, couples strongly to
$a$ and weakly to the Standard Model.  If $\mu\kappa/\lambda \gtrsim
60$~GeV, it acts as a Standard Model Higgs with only weak couplings to
$a$.  High values of $\lambda$ allow for exceptions to these
generalizations by softening the threshold between pure singlet and
pure doublet.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=0.7\linewidth, angle=90]{plots/newbranching/scomp13_vs_mkoverl.eps}
\caption{Singlet fraction of $h_1$ and $a_1$.  The singlet fraction of
  $a_1$ is nearly constant and approximately 1.0, while the singlet
  fraction of $h_1$ depends on $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ and $\lambda$. \label{fig:singlet}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Branching fractions}

The $h_1$ branching fractions depend primarily on the degree to which
$h_1$ is a singlet, and hence are highly dependent on
$\mu\kappa/\lambda$.  A highly-singlet $h_1$ simultaneously has low
Standard Model partial widths and a high $h_1 \to aa$ partial width,
so it decays to $aa$ with little competition from Standard Model modes.
A non-singlet $h_1$ has Standard Model-like branching fractions.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:sm_mukoverl1}, we show partial widths of $h_1$ to
$b\bar{b}$ and $WW^*$ as a function of $\mu\kappa/\lambda$, and see
the familiar threshold near 60~GeV.  In Fig.~\ref{fig:brhaa}, we
present the partial width and branching fraction of $h_1 \to aa$ with
$m_a < 2m_\tau$, which is maximized for most of $\mu\kappa/\lambda <
60$~GeV.  The second region of high $h_1 \to aa$ rate at
$\mu\kappa/\lambda > 60$~GeV and $\lambda > 0.4$ is related to the
softening of the $h_1$ singlet threshold with high $\lambda$
(Fig.~\ref{fig:singlet}).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=0.48\linewidth, angle=90]{plots/newbranching/gammabb_vs_mkoverl.eps}
\includegraphics[height=0.48\linewidth, angle=90]{plots/newbranching/gammaww_vs_mkoverl.eps}

\caption{Partial widths of $h_1 \to b\bar{b}$ and $WW^*$ as a function of
  $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ and $\lambda$, with the requirement that $m_a < 2m_\tau$. \label{fig:sm_mukoverl1}}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=0.48\linewidth, angle=90]{plots/newbranching/gammahaa_vs_lambda_vs_mkoverl.eps}
\includegraphics[height=0.48\linewidth, angle=90]{plots/newbranching/brhaa_vs_lambda_vs_mkoverl.eps}
\caption{The partial width (left) and branching fraction (right) of
  $h_1 \to a_1a_1$ in the $\lambda$, $\mu\kappa/\lambda$
  plane, with the requirement that $m_a < 2m_\tau$.  \label{fig:brhaa}}
\end{figure}

Since the nearly-singlet $a$ couples weakly to all Standard Model
particles, its branching fractions are determined primarily by
kinematics and competition with other modes.  The $a \to \mu\mu$
channel only becomes experimentally accessible below the $2m_\tau$
threshold, as is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:bramumu}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=0.7\linewidth, angle=90]{plots/newbranching/bra_vs_ma.eps}
\caption{The mass of $a_1$ and its branching fraction to muons for
  generated models.  The red line is the average as a function of
  $m_a$, demonstrating that the branching fraction is nearly a strict
  function of mass.  The threshold at 3.55~GeV is
  $2m_\tau$. \label{fig:bramumu}}
\end{figure}

%% To summarize the above, we present the combined branching fraction
%% $B_{h_1 \to aa \to 4\mu}$ as a function of $A_\kappa -
%% (\mbox{30~GeV})\lambda^2$ and $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ in
%% Fig.~\ref{fig:totals1}.  The region with high branching fraction ($>$ 1\%)
%% is located near $A_\kappa - (\mbox{30~GeV})\lambda^2 \approx 0$ (where
%% $m_a$ is below $2m_\tau$, yielding high $B_{a \to \mu\mu}$) and
%% $\mu\kappa/\lambda < 60$~GeV, where $B_{h_1 \to aa}$ is high.

\subsection{Cosmological constraints}

The NMSSM provides a neutralino dark matter candidate.  While it is
possible that the NMSSM neutralino accounts for all of the
cosmological dark matter, we can more generally assert that the NMSSM
neutralino density is not greater than the total dark matter density.

We used MicrOmegas package [ref], included with NMSSMTools, to compute
the NMSSM's dark matter constribution $\Omega_{NMSSM}$, requiring
models to generate less than the WMAP 5-year 95\% upper limits:
$\Omega_{NMSSM} \le 0.1099 + 2\times0.0062$.  Despite the low
neutralino masses at small $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ and $\lambda$
(Fig.~\ref{fig:darkmatter}-a), this region of parameter space yields
large $\Omega_{NMSSM}$, violating the WMAP bound
(Fig.~\ref{fig:darkmatter}-b).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=0.48\linewidth, angle=90]{plots/newbranching/lspmass.eps}
\includegraphics[height=0.48\linewidth, angle=90]{plots/newbranching/darkmatter.eps}

\caption{Left: mass of the lightest NMSSM neutralino in generated
  models versus $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ and $\lambda$.  Right: fraction of
  models excluded by the WMAP dark matter constraint.  Both require
  $m_a < 2m_\tau$.  \label{fig:darkmatter}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Production rates}

We calculate the $pp \to h_1$ production cross-section from two
contributions: $gg \to h_1$ and $b\bar{b} \to h_1$.  In each case, the
standard model $pp \to H_{SM}$ is derived using next-to-leading order
(NLO) tools, then corrected by a factor relating Standard Model
cross-sections to NMSSM, thereby yielding NLO cross-sections in the
NMSSM.

For $gg \to H_{SM}$, we used the HIGLU v2.102
package~\cite{Spira:1995rr}.  The ratio $\sigma(gg\to
h_1)/\sigma(gg\to H_{SM})$ is equal to the ratio of partial decay
widths $\Gamma(h_1\to gg)/\Gamma(H_{SM}\to gg)$, so one finds
\begin{equation}
\sigma(gg\to h_1)=\sigma(gg\to H_{SM})\frac{\Gamma(h_1\to gg)}{\Gamma(H_{SM}\to gg)}
=\sigma(gg\to H_{SM})\frac{Br(h_1\to gg)\Gamma^{tot}(h_1)}{\Gamma(H_{SM}\to gg)}.
\end{equation}
Therefore we have all components to evaluate $\sigma(gg\to h_1)$: we
use $\sigma(gg\to H_{SM})$ and $\Gamma(H_{SM}\to gg)$ calculated using
HIGLU at NLO, while $Br(h_1\to gg)$ and $\Gamma^{tot}(h_1)$ we obtain
using NMSSMTools.

For $b\bar{b}\to h_1$, we used the $b\bar{b}\to H_{SM}$ program
developed in \cite{Balazs:1998sb} and lately used also in
\cite{Belyaev:2005nu} where the QCD-improved (running) Yukawa
couplings have been used.  Then using $Y_{bbh_1}/Y_{bbH_{SM}}$ ratio
of Yukawa couplings calculated in NMSSMtools, one finds:
\begin{equation}
\sigma(b\bar{b}\to h_1)=\sigma(b\bar{b}\to H_{SM})
\left(\frac{Y_{bbh_1}}{Y_{bbH_{SM}}}\right)^2
\end{equation}
For the evaluation of production cross sections, CTEQ6M set for
parton density function set was used. 

Using these methods, we see in Fig.~\ref{fig:sm_mukoverl2} that the
production cross-section for 14~TeV $pp \to h_1 X$ follows primarily
from the $h_1$ singlet fraction, and therefore has a similar
dependence on $\mu\kappa/\lambda$.  The cross-section for 2~TeV
$p\bar{p} \to h_1 X$, which we will use to compute Tevatron limits,
follows the same pattern but with a lower overall rate.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=0.48\linewidth, angle=90]{plots/newbranching/crosssec_vs_mukoverl_gg.eps}
\includegraphics[height=0.48\linewidth, angle=90]{plots/newbranching/crosssec_vs_mukoverl_bb.eps}

  $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ and $\lambda$, from $gg$ (left) and $b\bar{b}$
  (right), with the requirement that $m_a < 2m_\tau$.
  \label{fig:sm_mukoverl2}}
\end{figure}

Note that the region of low production cross-section (low
$\mu\kappa/\lambda$ and low $\lambda$) in Fig.~\ref{fig:sm_mukoverl2}
is also excluded by the dark matter constraint in
Fig.~\ref{fig:darkmatter}-b.  Collider searches and cosmological
constraints are complimentary.

\subsection{Collider searches}

Four collider searches are relevant for the $m_a < 2m_\tau$ region of
the NMSSM:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Upsilon \to \gamma a$ searches by CLEO and BaBar,
\item $e^+e^- \to Zh_1$, $h_1 \to aa$ searches by LEP,
\item $p\bar{b} \to h_1 \to aa \to 4\mu$ and $2\mu$, $2\tau$ searches
  by the Tevatron, and
\item future $pp \to h_1 \to aa \to 4\mu$ searches by the LHC.
\end{itemize}

The first of these, $\Upsilon \to \gamma a$, is not sensitive to our
model because $a$ would need to have a significant non-singlet
fraction [ref] to couple to $\Upsilon$ and $\gamma$, whereas we have
shown (Fig.~\ref{fig:singlet}) that ths singlet fraction is 1.0 to a
high degree.

{\bf LEP searches: still need help!  We're not sure that NMSSMTools is
  doing the right thing, since its LEP constraint appears to be
  insensitive to the $h_1$ singlet fraction.}

We used the methods of the previous section to calculate the
sensitivity of the Tevatron to the model, using [ref] for Tevatron
limits: 6~fb on $\sigma(p\bar{p} \to h_1) \times B_{h_1 \to aa \to
  4\mu}$.  LEP measurements exclude $h_1 \to aa$ within the kinematic
limits of $e^+e^- \to Z h_1$, $45 < m_{h_1} < 86$~GeV, and the
detector efficiency for light CP-odd Higgs bosons, $m_a > 2$~GeV
[ref].  Figures~\ref{fig:exclusion} and ~\ref{fig:exclusion2} present
these experimental limits.

%%  The $\lambda$ and $A_\kappa$
%% parameters are restricted even in the wide scan to yield small $m_a$
%% values, important for large $B_{a\to\mu\mu}$. 
%% In particular, we have restricted $A_\kappa$ to be in the really

%% Furthermore, in our study we have found that
%% important parameter for distinguishing between conventional Higgs
%% decays and  ${h \to aa}$ decays is the ratio of $\kappa$ over $\lambda$, so
%% we perform uniform scans in this ratio, rather than $\kappa$ alone.

%% Our first results of wide scan are presented in Fig~\ref{mass_exclusion}
%% which demonstrates quite know fact that in  allowed NMSSM parameter 
%% space two most probable scenarios the lightest CP-even Higgs boson 
%% take place.
%% In the first scenario the 
%% scalar Higgs is the SM-like,
%% obeys SM/MSSM LEP constraints~\cite{lep1exclusion,lep2exclusion}
%% to be above about 115 GeV
%% and  decays primarily into conventional $WW^*$, $b\bar{b}$,
%% and $\tau^+\tau^-$ modes 
%% as one can see from see Fig.~\ref{mass_exclusion}(right).

%% The other scenario
%% occurs when the lightest CP-even Higgs boson
%% has dominant singlet component, i.e. it is almost a singlet.
%% In this case, such a Higgs boson can be very light surviving
%% LEP constraints~\cite{lep1exclusion,lep2exclusion} 
%% and dominantly decays into the pair of CP-odd Higgs bosons $h_1\to a_1 a_1$
%% which are also have dominant singlet component.
%% Being an almost singlet in this scenario, lightest CP-even Higgs boson
%% interacts weakly with SM fermions and gauge bosons
%% and this allows it to escape LEP constrains even if its mass 
%% as low as 20 GeV. 
%% \\
%% {\bf Jim, could you please check if 
%% $h_1$ as light as 20 GeV survives from the scan?

%% \subsection{The $h_1$ and $a_1$ branching ratios}

%% Since $a_1$ is essentially singlet, the singlet admixture
%% of $h_1$ defines its coupling to $a_1$
%% and the respective branching ratio $Br(h_1\to a1 a_1)$
%% as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{scomp13-vs-br-h-aa}
%% which presents singlet component of $h_1$
%% (mixing angle squared of the $h_1$ and the pure singlet state,
%% which is given by \verb|SCOMP(1,3)|$^2$ parameter in NMSSM tools)
%% versus $Br(h_1\to a1 a_1)$. 

%% \begin{figure}[htb]
%% \begin{center}

%% versus $Br(h_1\to a1 a_1)$
%% \label{scomp13-vs-br-h-aa}}
%% \end{center}
%% \end{figure}


%% The essential parameter which controls  the $h_1$ to be a
%% singlet or non-singlet we have found to be the ratio of
%% $\kappa/\lambda$  
%% ({\bf I think we need a plot scomp(1,3)$^2$
%% vs $\kappa/\lambda$  illustrating this}) 
%% which is eventually
%% controls  $Br(h_1\to a1 a_1)$ as demonstrated by $Br(h_1\to a1
%% a_1)$ vs  $\kappa/\lambda$ distribution in
%% Fig.~\ref{br-h-aa_vs_kap-lam}. One clearly see that for 
%% $\kappa/\lambda<0.3$, the $Br(h_1\to a1 a_1)$ is significant
%% which is related to the fact that the singlet component of
%% $h_1$ is large. One can see that the typical value of  
%% $Br(h_1\to a1 a_1)$ in this region is 70-100\%. 
%% ({\bf What are
%% competing Br of $h_1$ in this region?})

%% The singlet and non-singlet 
%% features of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson, $h_1$,
%% can be clearly disentangled in $\mu-\kappa/\lambda$
%% plane as one can see from Fig.\ref{mu-kaplam-scomp}.
%% For  $mu\simeq 110$~GeV,
%% $h_1$
%% becomes a singlet already for $\kappa/\lambda<0.5$ while for  $mu\simeq 200$~GeV
%% $h_1$ turns to be a singlet when $\kappa/\lambda<0.3$.

%% are essential variables defining the property of $h_1$
%% of being  singlet or non-singlet. 
%% ({\bf Why $\mu$ parameter was chosen in this narrow 100-200 GeV
%% range in our scan?\\
%%  One more remark/request: since  $\mu$ and $\kappa/\lambda$
%%  are very important parameters for the $h_1$, I would like to ask you to make
%%  plot

%% As we have mentioned above,

%% ($m_{a1} < 2m_\tau$),  however even though its non-singlet component is very smaill,

%%      This point  should be clearly explained from the very beginning,
%%      when we start presenting plots like these.
%%      The question is the following: for each point(small area) in $\lambda-A_\kappa$
%%      plain we can have different values of $m_{a1}$. So, for the plot do you chose
%%      the max or min value of the  $m_{a1}$ for the color map?\\
%%      Another remark: eventually the left figure should be replotted in more 
%%      sensible way} )

%% In Fig.~\ref{br-h-aa_vs_ma} we present the  value 
%% of  $Br(a_1\to\mu\mu)$ versus $m_{a1}$ which

%% It is important to stress that for a given $m_{a1}$
%% the value of  $Br(a_1\to\mu\mu)$ is essentially fixed
%% and is practically independent off other model parameters.
%% ({\bf We need more details on 
%% how this  Br is independent off other parameters
%% and how large deviations 
%% from the red curve can be. We should probably have
%% one more additional figure on this}).

%% \subsection{Production rates}

%% As we have shown,
%% the lightest CP-even Higgs boson, $h_1$,
%% typically has significant singlet component
%% in the region of our  interest 
%% (i.e. in the region of $m_{a1}<2 m_{\tau}$) 
%% and as we have found above,
%% both, $Br(h_1\to a_1 a_1)$  and $Br(a_1\to \mu\mu)$,
%% are quite significant. In the same time,
%% one should expect the suppression
%% of the $h_1$ production rate since $h_1$ interacts weakly with the 
%% fermions and gauge bosons  due to its  singlet nature.

%% In our study we have evaluated $pp\to h_1$ production cross section
%% for the $gg\to h_1$ and $b\bar{b}\to h_1$ process
%% at the next-to-leading order (NLO)
%% using the following 
%% procedure.

%% First, we have used  
%% HIGLU v2.102 package~\cite{Spira:1995rr} to calculate 
%% SM Higgs production cross section in $gg\to H_{SM}$ process.
%% Since the ratio of  $\sigma(gg\to h_1)/\sigma(gg\to H_{SM})$
%% production cross sections is equal to the ratio
%% of partial decay widths $\Gamma(h_1\to gg)/\Gamma(H_{SM}\to gg)$, one finds
%% \begin{equation}
%% \sigma(gg\to h_1)=\sigma(gg\to H_{SM})\frac{\Gamma(h_1\to gg)}{\Gamma(H_{SM}\to gg)}
%% =\sigma(gg\to H_{SM})\frac{Br(h_1\to gg)\Gamma^{tot}(h_1)}{\Gamma(H_{SM}\to gg)}.
%% \end{equation}
%% Therefore we have all components to evaluate $\sigma(gg\to h_1)$:
%% we use
%% $\sigma(gg\to H_{SM})$ and $\Gamma(H_{SM}\to gg)$ calculated  using HIGLU at  NLO,
%% while $Br(h_1\to gg)$ and $\Gamma^{tot}(h_1)$ we obtain using NMSSMtools.


%% \begin{figure}[htb]
%% \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{plots/cs3.eps}%
%% \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{plots/sig_vs_kaplam.eps}%
%% \caption{Combined 
%% $\sigma(gg\to {\cal H}) + \sigma(b\bar{b}\to {\cal H})$ production cross section
%% versus $m_{\cal H}$ for NMSSM and SM,
%% where ${\cal H}$ stands either for NMSSM or SM Higgs boson.
%% \label{cs3}}
%% \end{figure}

%% The cross section of $b\bar{b}\to h_1$ was also evaluated at
%% NLO as follows. The numerical calculation for the  SM Higgs
%% production in  $b\bar{b}\to H_{SM}$ fusion has been carried out
%% with the program developed in \cite{Balazs:1998sb} and lately
%% used also in \cite{Belyaev:2005nu} where the QCD-improved
%% (running) Yukawa couplings have been used. Then using
%% $Y_{bbh_1}/Y_{bbH_{SM}}$ ratio of  Yukawa couplings 
%% calculated  in NMSSMtools, one finds:
%% \begin{equation}
%% \sigma(b\bar{b}\to h_1)=\sigma(b\bar{b}\to H_{SM})
%% \left(\frac{Y_{bbh_1}}{Y_{bbH_{SM}}}\right)^2
%% \end{equation}
%% For the evaluation of production cross sections, CTEQ6M set for
%% parton density function set was used. 

%% Our first results  on the
%% combined  $\sigma(gg\to {\cal H}) + \sigma(b\bar{b}\to {\cal
%% H})$ production cross section versus $m_{\cal H}$ for NMSSM and
%% SM  are presented in Fig.\ref{cs3} (left), where ${\cal H}$ stands
%% either for NMSSM or SM Higgs boson. 
%% The right frame of Fig.\ref{cs3} 
%% presents $\sigma(gg\to {\cal H}) + \sigma(b\bar{b}\to {\cal
%% H})$ versus $\kappa/\lambda$ for NMSSM in more details. 
%% ({\bf Can we present(or
%% think about how to present) also results for $\sigma(gg\to
%% {\cal H})$ $\sigma(b\bar{b}\to {\cal H})$ separately to show
%% their relative contribution? }).
%% From Fig.~\ref{cs3} we can see that 
%% production cross section of NMSSM $h_1$ is indeed
%% suppressed typically by 2 orders of magnitude as compared to the
%% SM Higgs boson production in case when 
%% $h_1$ has a significant singlet component. The value of the
%% minimal suppression depends on the mass of $h_1$:
%% for $m_{h1}\simeq 40-50$ GeV, the maximal cross section of $h_1$
%% production is about 10 smaller than the SM one, while
%% when  $m_{h1}\simeq 115-125$ GeV its production cross section
%% is quite close to SM and can be as large as about 25 pb 
%% once the singlet component of $h_1$
%% vanishes.

%% Since we study the whole production and decay chain
%% $pp\to h_1 \to a_1 a_1\to 4\mu$ let us  look at the
%% cross section of the four-muon production after application
%% of the respective branching ratios from NMMStoos
%% to the $h_1$ production cross section which we have evaluated.

%% Even though the four-muon signal rates from NMSSM are not high,

\section{Analysis}

The main characteristic of the signal is two back-to-back di-muon pairs with pair consisting of 
spatially close muons. The di-muon pairs should have invariant masses consistent with each, which
serve as a measurement of $m_a$, and the four muon invariant mass distributionshould have a spike 
that corresponding to the $m_h$ mass. We use these striking features of signal events in designing 
the analysis with a reasonably high acceptance and very low backgrounds suitable for early LHC running.

\subsection{Signal Simulation}
We use Pythia to generate signal event templates with $m_h$ in the range from 70 to 140 GeV/c$^2$
and $m_a$  in the range from 0.5 to 4 GeV/c$^2$). For detector response emulation, we chose the CMS 
detector as a benchmark and used its parameters descibed in CMS Technical Design Report. The key 
parameters important for this analysis are muon momentum resolution, low threshold on muons to 
reach the muon system, acceptance and average muon reconstruction efficiencies. {\bf we should quote 
the numbers.} 

\subsection{Event Reconstruction}
The analysis starts by requiring at least four muon candidates with $p_T>5$ \gevc in the fiducial volume of the
detector. At least one of the four muons has to have $p_T>20$ $\gevc$ to suppress major backgrounds and to 
satisfy trigger requirements. Each event must have at least two muon candidates of positive and negative 
charge each. In events satisfying these critiria, we define quadruplets of candidates consisting of two 
positive and two negatively charged muon candidates. Although very unlikely, there can be more than one 
quadruplet per event, e.g. if there are five muons in the event. Each such quadruplet if preserved until the
end of the analysis.

Next, we sort the four muon candidates in quadruplet into two di-muon pairs. We minimize the quantity 
$(\Delta R(\mu_i,\mu_j)^2 + \Delta R (\mu_k,\mu_l)^2)$ under the constarint that each di-muon pair
consists of two muon candidates of opposite charge. We discard quadruplets in which $\Delta R$ between 
muons in any of the two pair exceeds {\bf 0.5???} as this cut is 100\% efficient for the signal while
it can diminish the size of the data sample by removing events, which have topology inconsistent with
signal. At his point in the analysis, the invariant mass of each of the di-muon pair, $m_{12} and m_{34}$, 
is calculated as well as the invariant mass of all four muons, which we denote as $m_{1234}$ or $M$. 
Figure \ref{muon_pairs_masses_invariant_mass}a) shows the invariant mass of the muon pairs passing 
all selections ($m_{12}$ and $m_{34}$ are combined into a single distribution) for two choices of
$m_h$ and $m_a$. Figure \ref{muon_pairs_masses_invariant_mass}b) shows the distribution of the invariant
mass $M$ of the four muon system for two benchmark points. Further background suppression can be
obtained by adding the isolation requirement to one or both di-muon pairs in the event, e.g. by
setting the upper bound on the sum of transverse momenta of all tracks in a cone around the reconstructed
direction of the di-muon pair excluding momenta of the two muon tracks. Such requirement can allow a 
very substantial suppression of the dominant source of the background coming from events with one or more 
muons originating from jets. We choose not to use this critirea as our estimates show that the final rate 
of such background events is already very low. If data shows larger contribution of these events, 
this isolation requirement would allow bringing backgrounds back to very low level at a moderate
cost to signal acceptance.

Acceptance of the selections listed above is shown in Table \ref{acceptance} and is large thanks to
the high coverage of the CMS muon system. Figures \ref{signal_acceptance}a) and 
\ref{signal_acceptance}b) illustrate the dependence of acceptance on values of $m_h$ and $m_a$.

One can further reduce the background events and zoom on the region of interest of
this analysis by applying cuts on $m_{12}$, $m_{34}$, $M$, and require that measured
values of $m_{12}$ and $m_{34}$ are consistent within  uncertainties. Instead of
applying these cuts explicitly, we develop a statistical procedure that performs a fit
in  a 3D space of measured values of $(m_{12},m_{34}, m_{1234})$ taking into account
kinematical properties of  signal events. This approach allows maximizing signal
acceptance and therefore statistical power of the analysis and is discussed in what
follows. It is also convenient from experimental point of view as the backgrounds
will  be distributed in some smooth fashion over the 3D space allowing fitting the 3D
distribution to estimate  backgrounds directly from the data. Potential signal would
appear as a concentration of events in one specific  region in the 3D space (a 3D
``bump''). Figure \ref{muon_pairs_masses_diff} shows the difference in the 
reconstructed masses of the two di-muon pairs in signal events, which determines the
size of the signal region  in the ($m_{12}, m_{34}$) plane.

To give the reader a better idea on the signal significance of this analysis, we quote
efficiencies and  background contamination (next section) for a set of cuts that zooms
on the highest significance region.  The cuts we use are $M>60$ \gevcc, $m_{12} < 4$,
$m_{34} < 4$, and $|m_{12}-m_{34}|<0.08+0.005*(m_{12}+m_{34})$.  The latter cut is
enforcing the requirement that the two pair masses are consistent with each other and 
takes into account widening of the absolute resolution in the reconstructed di-muon
mass as a function of mass.

\subsection{Background Estimation}
The main backgrounds in this analysis are QCD multijet events where muons originate
from either heavy flavor quark decays or from $K/\pi$ decays in flight. We also
considered electroweak backgrounds and direct J/psi production, but found those
contributions completely negligible. Requirement of four  sufficiently energetic muons
in the event drastically reduces contributions of all background processes.  Further
constarints on the correlation of di-muon pair masses and relatively high invariant
mass of the four muon system allows an essentially zero background analysis. In the
following we discuss estimation  of these backgrounds.

\subsubsection{QCD backgrounds}

The largest contribution comes from rare QCD multi-jet events with four energetic
reconstructed  muons that are produced either in heavy flavor decays of b and c mesons
(real muons) or in $K/\pi$  decays in flight. The punch-through contamination is
heavily suppresed due to massive shileding  of the CMS muon system.  The multi-jet
background is drastically reduced by the requirement of  at least one muon with
$p_T>20$ GeV/c and the follow up selections. Background events surviving  selections
can be divided into two fractions: events with all four real muons from heavy flavor 
meson decays and events with typically three real muons and a misidentified muon from
$K/\pi$  decays in flight. The first source is estimated using Pythia MC $2 \to 2$ QCD
jet production  by selecting generated muons and smearing distributions using detector
resolutions and efficiencies.  The second contamination is estimated using the same
Pythia sample by selecting events with two  or three real muons and one or more
charged pions or kaons satisfying $p_T$ and $\eta$ requirements  used for muons. Each
such event is assigned a weight calculated as the probability that available $K/\pi$
mesons decay into muons before reaching radius of $\simeq$2 meters ({\bf halfway into
the hadronic  calorimeter - is it what we want?}). We find that the level of
backgrounds due to misidentifications is  comparable to the rate of the backgrounds
associated with real muons from heavy flavor decays.  While the fraction of remaining
events after acceptance cuts does not appear negligible, these events are spread over
the 3D space with only a tiny fraction of them appearing in the region where signal
would appear, see Tables \ref{bckgr_cuts_efficiency_reco_level} and
\ref{bckgr_cuts_number_reco_level}.  If necessary, these remaining backgrounds can be
completely eliminated by applying a loose track isolation  requirement on one of both
of the di-muon pairs.

\subsubsection{Electroweak four lepton backgrounds}

{\bf We use CompHEP to generate a large sample of events with four muons in final
state coming from the electroweak processes. The cross-section of this process is 0.5
pb ({\bf Sasha, is this correct? Kind of sounds very  small!!!}) and after a cut on
the first muon $p_T>20$ GeV/c, the large chunk of remaining events are  $Z\gamma^*$
type events. Very few of these events have muons that can be arranged into pairs with
low invariant  mass, and the fraction of events with similar masses of the pairs is
completely negligible.}

\subsubsection{Other SM Backgrounds}

We also studied several other processes, e.g. direct $J/\psi$ production process that
can produce  a pair of muons with mass in the range of interest of this analysis and
another pair of muons can  come from decays in flight. We used Pythia MC and a
weighing technique similar to the QCD case and  find that this background is
completely negligible. Other SM backgrounds (top, W+jets) are negligible  in the
region of interest of this analysis.

\subsubsection{Summary}

While the number of background events past the acceptance stage and that are used in
the fit is not small,  the fitting procedure described in the next section is
effectively reducing the region of interest to  events that have kinematic properties
of signal events making backgrounds nearly completely negligible, as  illustarted by
the lower part of Table \ref{bckgr_cuts_number_reco_level} showing the number of
expected  background events after each cut in a dataset corresponding to 100 \ipb of
LHC data. {\bf We need a plot  to show background distributions, e.g. m12 and m1234 -
we have them, just need to clean up}.

\section{Statistical Analysis of the Data}

To maximize sensitivity and emulate real data analysis techniques, we define a likelihood function in the 3D space 
$(m_{pair \; 1}, \; m_{pair \; 2}, M)$, where M is the four muon invariant mass. The likelihood is defined as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal L}(m_h, m_a, \sigma(pp \to h)) = \prod_i {\cal P}(\sigma(pp \to h) \; L \; BR_{h \to aa} BR^2_{a \to \mu \mu} L
\alpha(m_h, m_a) N^S_i (m_a, m_h) + L \; N^B_i, N^D_i)
\end{eqnarray}
where $i$ runs over bins in 3D space of $(m_{12}, m_{34}, m_{1234})$, $m_h$ is the light higgs mass, $m_a$ is 
axial higgs mass, ${\cal P}(\nu, N)$ is Poisson probability for observing $N$ events when the true rate is $\nu$.
Other parameters are dataset luminosity $L$, acceptance of the signal events $\alpha (m_h, m_a)$ , $N^S_i$ is the 
fraction of reconstructed signal events in bin $i$ ($\Sigma N^S_i = 1$), $N^B_i$ is the rate of background events 
in bin $i$ per unit of luminosity.

Because of the limited statistics in the Monte Carlo samples describing QCD backgrounds, we parameterize the
background distriution in the $(m_{12}, m_{34}, M)$ space using the following function:
\begin{eqnarray}
B(m_{12}, m_{34}, m_{1234}) = f(m_{12}) \times f(m_{34}) \times g(m_{1234}) \\
f(m_{12}) = \\
g(m_{1234}) = ,
\end{eqnarray}
This simple function describes backgrounds very well in the region of interest because typical four muon invariant mass values 
are much larger than the narrow range of di-muon pair masses effectively leading to very little correlation of the two. 
An important note is that using this parameterization requires that in the data analysis the order of pairs has to
be randomized (e.g. designating $m_{12}$ to be the mass of the pair that contains highest $p_T$ muon will break factorization),
and so we randomize them in the analysis. Fitted parameters of the function are shown in Table \ref{table_background_fit_parameters}. 
We verified that background events found in MC are well described by this function by running pseudoexperiments using paramaterized 
distribution and verifying that the p-value for the outcome similar to what is observed in MC is high.

Thus defined likelihood function can be used to calculate the 95\% C.L.\ upper limit on the cross-section times branching ratio
of the $h \to \mu \mu \mu \mu$ signal or determine the intergrated luminosity required to make a discovery at a certain level. 
These results can then be translated into the exclusion region in $(m_a, m_h)$ parameter space or NMSSM parameter space.  
To demonstrate performance of this technique, Figures \ref{likelihood_10pb}a) and b) show calculated likelihood functions 
for two pseudoexperiments, in one of which no signal was injected into the pseudodata and in the other a certain amount of 
signal was admixed in addition to background contributions. In both cases, likelihood function shows expected behavior.

We calculate the 95\% C.L.\ upper limit on the product $\sigma(pp \to h) B_{h \to aa} B^2_{a \to \mu \mu} \, \alpha$, 
using Bayesian technique which is 0.0293~pb at $L = 100$~pb$^{-1}$, approximately 3 events.  In vast majority of 
pseudoexperiments, this limit is independent of $m_h$ and $m_a$ because the effective signal region that dominates 
signal significance in the fitter is essentially background free and probability to observe any pseudodata event is 
very small. Since $B_{a \to \mu\mu}$ is nearly a function of $m_a$ only, it can be factored out, and the corresponding 
upper limit on $\sigma(pp \to h) B_{h \to aa} \alpha$ is presented in Table~\ref{table_bramumu_factorized}.  The upper 
limit on $\sigma(pp \to h) B_{h \to aa}$ is shown as a function of $m_h$ and $m_a$ in Table~\ref{table_both_factorized} 
by factoring out $\alpha$ as well.  Keep in mind that $B_{h \to aa}$ is close to 100\% in much of our preferred region 
of NMSSM parameter space.
