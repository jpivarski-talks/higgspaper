We explore the potential of Large Hadron Collider to observe  $h_1\to
a_1a_1\to 4\mu$ signal from the lightest lightest scalar Higgs boson
($h_1$) decaying into two  lightest pseudoscalar Higgs bosons($a_1$) 
followed by their decays into 4 muons within the Next-to-Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM).
The signature under study allows to cover the  NMSSM parameter space
with  $M_{a_1}$ below 3.5 GeV and large $Br(h_1\to a_1 a_1)$ 
which has not been studied previously. In case of  such a scenario,
the suggested strategy of the observation of 
$4\mu$ signal with the respective background suppression
would provide a unique way to discover
the lightest scalar NMSSM Higgs boson.

\section{Introduction}

The next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM)
\cite{Nilles:1982dy,Frere:1983ag,Ellis:1988er,%
Drees:1988fc,Ellwanger:1993hn,Ellwanger:1993xa,%
Elliott:1993bs,Pandita:1993tg,Ellwanger:1995ru,%
King:1995vk,Franke:1995tc,Ellwanger:1996gw,Miller:2003ay}
is extended by one singlet superfield in addition to the particle content
of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM).
NMSSM has several new attractive features as compared to MSSM.
First  of all, NMSSM elegantly solves so called $\mu$-problem~\cite{mu-problem}:
the scale of the $\mu$-parameter is automatically generated 
at the electroweak or SUSY  scale when the singlet Higgs acquires 
a vacuum expectation value.
On the other hand NMSSM can solve fine-tuning and little hierarchy problems
of MSSM~\cite{Dermisek:2005ar}.
The upper mass limit on the lightest  CP-even
Higgs boson in NMSSM is larger than in MSSM and since more
parameter space survives LEP II bounds from the Higgs search,  NMSSM
is less fine-tuned.
On the other hand  there is additional mechanism for the reduction of
fine-tuning since 
LEP II bounds from the Higgs search can be partly avoided if the
branching of  $h_1\to a_1 a_1$ decay is significant ($h_1$ and
$a_1$ stands for the lightest   CP-even  and CP-odd Higgs bosons respectively).
This decay channel of $h_1$ diminishes the branching ratios for
conventional modes used in direct Higgs  searches and largely softens
direct Higgs boson mass limits from LEP. 

One should stress that due to the extended scalar sector (in comparison to MSSM)
NMSSM offers richer Higgs collider phenomenology
\cite{nmssm-ph1,nmssm-ph2,%
nmssm-ph2b,nmssm-ph3,nmssm-ph4,%
nmssm-ph5,nmssm-ph6,nmssm-ph6a,nmssm-ph7}
as well as richer  cosmological Dark Matter implications 
related to the presence of the fifth  neutralino (``singlino"),
relic density for  which can be achieved to be correct one~\cite{nmssm-dm}.

The collider phenomenology of the Higgs sector of the NMSSM
is very interesting in several aspects, therefore a short historical 
introduction is in  order.
In \cite{nmssm-ph2} the first attempt to establish `no-lose' theorem for NMSSM
has been done. This theorem states that LHC has a potential to discover at least one
NMSSM Higgs boson in the conventional mode given that Higgs-to-Higgs decay modes 
are not important. However the point is that  Higgs-to-Higgs decay modes
can be important as has been shown and studied later on
in analysis devoted to re-establishing   of `no-lose' 
theorem~\cite{nmssm-ph2b,nmssm-ph3,nmssm-ph4,nmssm-ph5,nmssm-ph6,nmssm-ph6a,nmssm-ph7}
for the case when  $h_1\to a_1 a_1$ decay is significant
and $a_1$ is light. So far, the case of the lightest $a_1$  was explored 
for $m_{a_1}$ below $2b$-quark threshold but above $2\tau$ one,
$2m_\tau <m_{a_1}<2m_b$, establishing the scope of
the $4\tau$ channel in Higgs-strahlung and Vector Boson Fusion
for the NMSSM No-Lose Theorem at the LHC~\cite{nmssm-ph7}.
Theses analysis  require a substantial integrated luminosity (10-100 fb$^{-1}$)
and quite challenging analysis in the technical sense.


In this paper we explore the  mass region of  $a_1$ 
with the mass below $2\tau$ threshold: $m_{a_1}<2m_\tau$.
In this case, which has not been studied previously, we 
explore the potential of $h_1 \to a_1a_1 \to \mu \mu \mu \mu$ signature at the LHC.
Unlike searches for $4\tau$ signature,
the measurement of invariant mass of muon pair provides a 
direct estimate of $m_{a_1}$ which defines a clear set of the kinematical
cuts for the background suppression. 
Further, this
channel is essentially free of backgrounds and therefore allows to use
direct gluon fusion production combined with  $b\bar{b}$ fusion production
instead of subdominant  vector boson fusion or associate 
Higgs production processes used in case of $4\tau$ signature to to suppress large QCD
backgrounds.

We demonstrate that the analysis in
the four muon mode has excellent sensitivity for Lightest CP-even NMSSM Higgs boson
and can be performed with just  a handful of first LHC data and requires 
very little in terms of detector performance  except reasonably robust tracking 
for muons and well functioning muon system. To make 
this a realistic analysis, we use parameters of the CMS experiment in designing
selections and estimating background contributions.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In Section II we study the NMSSM parameters space 
for which $m_{a_1}<2m_\mu$ case of our study is realized.
In Section III we perform signal versus background analysis
and present our final  results in Section IV.
In Section V we draw our conclusions.

\section{NMSSM Parameter Space}

\subsection{The model and its parameters}
In our study we consider the simplest version of the NMSSM
\cite{Nilles:1982dy,Frere:1983ag,Ellis:1988er,%
Drees:1988fc,Ellwanger:1993hn,Ellwanger:1993xa,%
Elliott:1993bs,Pandita:1993tg,Ellwanger:1995ru,%
King:1995vk,Franke:1995tc,Ellwanger:1996gw},
in which the $\mu\widehat{H_1}\widehat{H_2}$ term of the 
MSSM superpotential is replaced by
\begin{equation}
\lambda  \widehat{S} \widehat{H}_1 \widehat{H}_2 + \frac{\kappa}{3}  \widehat{S}^3 \mbox{.}
\label{eq:superpot} 
\end{equation}
This makes the superpotential scale invariant.  In general, we have five
soft braking terms; in the "non-universal" case,
\begin{equation}
  m_{H_1}^2 H_1^2 + m_{H_2}^2 H_2^2  + m_{S}^2 S^2 
+ \lambda A_\lambda H_1 H_2 S +  \frac{\kappa}{3} A_\kappa S^3.
\label{eq:soft} 
\end{equation}
In the above equations, capital letters with tildes denote superfields
while symbols without tildes denote the scalar component of the respective
superfield.

Soft breaking parameters
$m_{H_1}^2$ , $m_{H_2}^2$  and $m_{S}^2$ 
from Eq.~\ref{eq:soft} can  be replaced by
$M_Z$, the ratio  of the doublet Higgs vacuum expectation values (VEVs) $\tan\beta$,
and $\mu = \lambda \langle S \rangle$
(where $\langle S \rangle$ denotes the VEV of the singlet Higgs field)
through the three minimization equations of the Higgs potential.
Assuming that the Higgs sector is CP conserving,
the NMSSM Higgs sector at the Electro-Weak (EW) scale is uniquely defined
by 14 parameters:
$\tan\beta$,
the trilinear couplings in the superpotential $\lambda$ and $\kappa$, the
corresponding soft SUSY breaking parameters $A_\lambda$ and $A_\kappa$,
the effective $\mu$ parameter $\mu = \lambda \langle S \rangle$,
the gaugino mass parameters $M_1$, $M_2$ and $M_3$,
the squark and slepton trilinear couplings
$A_{t}$,  $A_{b}$ and  $A_\tau$,
and the squark and slepton mass parameters $M_{f_L}$ and $M_{f_R}$.
For simplicity, we assume here the
universality within 3 generations for the last two parameters, leaving
only 6 parameters.

\subsection{Phenomenology of the low-$m_a$ region of the NMSSM}

To present our region of interest, $m_a < 2m_\tau$, we scan the NMSSM
parameter space using the NMSSMTools
package~\cite{nmssmtools1,nmssmtools2,nmssmtools3}, applying all known
phenomenological and experimental constraints except the following:
the cosmological dark matter measured by WMAP-5~[ref], direct
$p\bar{p} \to h_1 \to aa \to 4\mu$ and $2\mu$, $2\tau$ searches by the
Tevatron~[ref], direct $e^+e^- \to Zh_1$, $h_1 \to aa$ searches by
LEP~[ref], and direct $\Upsilon \to \gamma a$ searches by CLEO~[ref]
and BaBar~[ref].  These important constraints will be applied
explicitly to our region of interest in a later section.

We scanned the NMSSM parameter space uniformly in the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item 100~GeV $<$ $\mu$ $<$ 1000~GeV
\item 0 $<$ $\lambda$ $<$ 1
\item 1.5 $<$ $\tan\beta$ $<$ 50
\item $-$1~TeV $<$ $A_\lambda$ $<$ 5~TeV
\item 0 $<$ $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ $<$ 120~GeV
\item $-$3~GeV $<$ $A_\kappa - (\mbox{30~GeV})\lambda^2$ $<$ 0.1~GeV.
\end{itemize}
The first four are conventional, broad ranges over the probable values
of $\mu$, $\lambda$, $\tan\beta$, and $A_\lambda$.  The range determined
by the fifth requirement, on the combination $\mu\kappa/\lambda$, covers 
two equal size but phenomeologically distinct sub-regions, as illustrated in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:hmass_mukoverl}. In the low $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ sub-region, the 
lighest CP-even higgs $h_1$ is light ($m_{mbox{h_1}} \approx 2 \mu\kappa/\lambda$) 
and mostly a singlet and $h_2$ is the SM-like higgs, while in the high 
$\mu\kappa/\lambda$ one $h_1$ is the SM-like Higgs with the mass of 
approximately 125 $\gevcc$ and $h_2$ is heavy. The last requirement, on the 
combination $A_\kappa -(\mbox{30~GeV})\lambda^2$, is motivated by the 
shape of the low $m_a$ domain shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:amass2}-a. It selects 
a region with a roughly uniform distribution of light $m_a$ between 0 and 30~GeV.  
The phenomenology of $pp \to h_1 \to a_1a_1 \to 4\mu$ is determined 
almost exclusively by the $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ ratio, $\lambda$, and 
$A_\kappa$.  Varying $\tan\beta$ and $A_\lambda$ has negligible effect 
on the masses, branching fractions, and production cross-section.

\caption{Left: Lightest ($h_1$) and second-lightest ($h_2$)
  CP-even Higgs masses as a function of $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ and
  $\lambda$.  The density of generated points surviving constraints is
  shown in the color scale, and the lines are average mass as a function of 
  $\mu\kappa/\lambda$, with $\lambda < 0.01$ (dashed line) and

 \label{fig:hmass_mukoverl}}
\end{figure}

The mass of the lightest CP-odd Higgs is related to $A_\kappa$,
$\lambda$, and $\mu\kappa/\lambda$.  In the $A_\kappa$-$\lambda$
plane, $m_a$ grows with distance from a $A_\kappa =
(\mbox{30~GeV})\lambda^2$ line, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:amass2}-a.
The light $m_a$ region is therefore $A_\kappa -
(\mbox{30~GeV})\lambda^2 \lesssim 0$.  Below zero, {\bf assumption X
  fails, making this an unphysical region.  Sasha: what happens in
  this region?  What word can we use to substitute ``unphysical?''}
Fig.~\ref{fig:amass2}-b shows that $m_a$ is also a function of
$\mu\kappa/\lambda$.  The full dependence is approximately described
by $\left[A_\kappa - (\mbox{30~GeV}) \lambda^2\right] \, \cdot \,
\frac{\mu\kappa}{\lambda} \approx -(0.58 \, m_a)^2$ (true for 80\% of
sampled points with at least 10\% accuracy). {\bf Expression for $m_a$
can probably be written explicitly from the model in terms of model 
parameters?!!}

\caption{Left: Singlet fraction of $h_1$ and $a_1$.  The singlet fraction of
  $a_1$ is nearly constant and approximately 1.0, while the singlet
  fraction of $h_1$ depends on $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ and $\lambda$. 
Right: Branching fraction of $h_1 \to a_1a_1$ in the $\lambda$, $\mu\kappa/\lambda$
  plane, with the requirement that $m_a < 2m_\tau$. \label{fig:singlet}}
\end{figure}

The couplings of $h_1$ and $a$, to each other and to Standard Model
particles, are determined by their singlet fractions. In addition 
to that, $h_1 aa$ coupling also depends on $\lambda$, see Eq.~\ref{eq_soft}.  
For the entire region of interest, $a_1$ is almost exactly a pure singlet 
(the non-singlet fraction $|zzz - 1| \lesssim 10^{-5}$), while the singlet 
fraction of $h_1$ depends on $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ and $\lambda$, as
illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:singlet}).  {\bf What
  is $zzz$?  These values are $SCOMP(1,3)^2$ and $PCOMP(1,2)^2$; what
  symbol will we use for this in the text?}  If $\mu\kappa/\lambda
\lesssim 60$~GeV, $h_1$ is predominantly singlet and, as long as $\lambda$
is not vanishing, has strong $h_1 aa$ coupling and weakly couples to the 
Standard Model particles.  For $\mu\kappa/\lambda \gtrsim 60$~GeV, $h_1$ 
is a SM-like Higgs with only weak couplings to $a$.  High values of 
$\lambda$ allow for exceptions to these generalizations by softening 
the threshold between pure singlet and pure doublet.


\begin{figure}

\caption{Partial width of $h_1 \to b\bar{b}$ as a function of
  $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ and $\lambda$, with the requirement that $m_a < 2m_\tau$. \label{fig:sm_mukoverl1}}
\end{figure}


Therefore, $h_1$ branching fractions depend primarily on the degree to which
$h_1$ is a singlet, and hence are highly dependent on $\mu\kappa/\lambda$.  
A highly-singlet $h_1$ simultaneously has weak coupling to Standard Model 
particles (for both fermions and bosons, see Fig.~\ref{fig:sm_mukoverl1}) and, 
as long as $\lambda$ is not vanishingly small, has strong $h_1 aa$ coupling, 
so it decays to $aa$ with little competition from Standard Model modes. A 
non-singlet $h_1$ has Standard Model-like branching fractions. These observations
are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:brhaa}-a that shows branching fraction of $h_1 \to aa$ 
as a function of $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ for NMSSM models with $m_a < 2m_\tau$. Branching 
fraction of $h_1 \to aa$ is generally large for $\mu\kappa/\lambda < 60$~GeV except
for very small $\lambda$.  The second isle of high branching fraction of $h_1 \to aa$
at larger $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ and $\lambda > 0.4$ is related to the softening of the 
$h_1$ singlet fraction for high values of $\lambda$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:singlet}).

\end{figure}

Because the coupling of a light nearly-singlet $a$ to all SM particles is strongly but 
equally suppressed, its branching fractions are not affected by the singlet fraction of 
$a_1$ and follow the standard mass hierarchy. For $m_a < 2m_\tau$ the branching fraction
for $a \to \mu\mu$ becomes significant, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:brhaa}-b, making 
this channel a viable mode for experimental searches.

%\subsection{Exisiting Experimental Constraints}

\subsubsection{Cosmological Constraints}

Just like in MSSM, lightest neutralino in NMSSM is the cold dark matter candidate.  
To restrict our scan to models consistent with experimental measurements of relic 
density, we used MicrOmegas package [ref] to compute the NMSSM's dark matter 
contribution $\Omega_{NMSSM}$ and required $\Omega_{NMSSM} \le 0.1099 + 2\times0.0062$,
which corresponds to the 95\% upper limits from the WMAP 5-year dataset. 

Requirement of $\Omega_{NMSSM}$ consistency with the WMAP data excludes the region of 
small $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ and $\lambda$ as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:exclusion}. The 
WMAP bound also severely restricts the region of very small $\lambda$ for all $\mu\kappa/\lambda$.

%\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Constraints from Direct Searches at Colliders}

{\bf LEP searches: still need help!  We're not sure that NMSSMTools is
  doing the right thing, since its LEP constraint appears to be
  insensitive to the $h_1$ singlet fraction.}
Figure~\ref{fig:exclusion}-c shows the density of models surviving both WMAP and LEP constraints.
 LEP measurements exclude $h_1 \to aa$ within the kinematic
limits of $e^+e^- \to Z h_1$, $45 < m_{h_1} < 86$~GeV, and the
detector efficiency for light CP-odd Higgs bosons, $m_a > 2$~GeV
[ref].  Figures~\ref{fig:exclusion} and ~\ref{fig:exclusion2} present
these experimental limits.

In addition to LEP data, there have been several recent attempts aimed at direct searches. 
Searches at lower energy $e^+e^-$ colliders have been focusing on searching for the CP-odd Higgs 
via $\Upsilon \to \gamma a_1$ followed by $a_1$ decay to leptons. Neither of these searches can 
lead to any constraints on the NMSSM models with low $m_a$ because $a_1$ is always heavily dominated 
by singlet component (see the top plot in Fig.~\ref{fig:singlet}) and has absolutely negligible 
$bba_1$ coupling. {\bf (Is it sufficiently generic statement or is there smth specific in what we 
do other that asking for low $m_a$ that makes $a_1$ a singlet?)}. 
{\bf Did CLEO even look for such light mA? I thought they we looking for taus}

Another recent paper by $D\O$~\cite{d0-low-ma} describes the search for $a_1 a_1 \to \mu \mu \mu \mu$
using Tevatron data. To interpret the $D\O$ result, we calculate the NLO production cross-section for
$p \bar{p} \to h_1$ in NMSSM using the SM NLO calculations for $gg \to H_{SM}$~\cite{Spira:1995rr} and $b\bar{b} \to H_{SM}$
with QCD-improved (running) Yukawa couplings~\cite{Balazs:1998sb} corrected for differences in coupling between SM 
and NMSSM using the NMSSMTools:
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma(gg\to h_1)=\sigma(gg\to H_{SM})\frac{\Gamma(h_1\to gg)}{\Gamma(H_{SM}\to gg)} \\ \nonumber
=\sigma(gg\to H_{SM})\frac{Br(h_1\to gg)\Gamma^{tot}(h_1)}{\Gamma(H_{SM}\to gg)} \\
\sigma(b\bar{b}\to h_1)=\sigma(b\bar{b}\to H_{SM})
\left(\frac{Y_{bbh_1}}{Y_{bbH_{SM}}}\right)^2
\end{eqnarray}
where $\sigma(gg\to H_{SM})$ and $\Gamma(H_{SM}\to gg)$ is calculated using
HIGLU, while $Br(h_1\to gg)$, $\Gamma^{tot}(h_1)$, and the ratio of Yukawa couplings 
$Y_{bbh_1}/Y_{bbH_{SM}}$ are obtained using NMSSMTools.

We select models for which $\sigma(p\bar{p} \to h_1) \times B_{h_1 \to aa \to
4\mu}$ does not exceed the upper limit of $\sigma_{95\%}=6$~fb obtained in~\cite{d0-low-ma}. {\bf BECAUSE 
PUBLISHED LIMIT MUST BE A FUNCTION OF h1 MASS, WE CORRECT $\sigma_{95\%}$ BY SCALING IT WITH $\alpha(m_{h1})/ \alpha_0$,
WHERE $\alpha_0$ is the acceptance given in ~\cite{d0-low-ma} for mass $m_{h1}=XXX$ and $\alpha(m_{h1}) = (m_{h1}/XXX) \times \alpha_0$}. 
Figure~\ref{fig:exclusion} shows the density of low $m_a$ models surviving WMAP, LEP and Tevatron constraints. 
It turns out that for $\mu\kappa/\lambda<60$ (non-SM $h_1$ lighter than 120 GeV), the cross-section 
is strongly suppressed even compared to SM for low $m_a$ because $h_1$ has a large singlet fraction. For 
larger $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ the lighest CP-even higgs $h_1$ becomes the SM-like Higgs and has negligible 
$h_1 \to aa$ branching.  These effects lead to Tevatron excluding only a very small impact on the allowed 
NMSSM parameter space. A significant improvement in Tevatron reach for NMSSM would have required a large increase 
in integrated luminosity likely leaving it up to LHC to make a definitive discovery or exclusion of
NMSSM models with low $m_a$.

%%  The $\lambda$ and $A_\kappa$
%% parameters are restricted even in the wide scan to yield small $m_a$
%% values, important for large $B_{a\to\mu\mu}$.

%% important parameter for distinguishing between conventional Higgs
%% decays and  ${h \to aa}$ decays is the ratio of $\kappa$ over $\lambda$, so
%% we perform uniform scans in this ratio, rather than $\kappa$ alone.

%% Our first results of wide scan are presented in Fig~\ref{mass_exclusion}
%% which demonstrates quite know fact that in  allowed NMSSM parameter 
%% space two most probable scenarios the lightest CP-even Higgs boson 
%% take place.
%% In the first scenario the 
%% scalar Higgs is the SM-like,
%% obeys SM/MSSM LEP constraints~\cite{lep1exclusion,lep2exclusion}
%% to be above about 115 GeV
%% and  decays primarily into conventional $WW^*$, $b\bar{b}$,
%% and $\tau^+\tau^-$ modes 
%% as one can see from see Fig.~\ref{mass_exclusion}(right).

%% The other scenario
%% occurs when the lightest CP-even Higgs boson
%% has dominant singlet component, i.e. it is almost a singlet.
%% In this case, such a Higgs boson can be very light surviving
%% LEP constraints~\cite{lep1exclusion,lep2exclusion} 
%% and dominantly decays into the pair of CP-odd Higgs bosons $h_1\to a_1 a_1$
%% which are also have dominant singlet component.
%% Being an almost singlet in this scenario, lightest CP-even Higgs boson
%% interacts weakly with SM fermions and gauge bosons
%% and this allows it to escape LEP constrains even if its mass 
%% as low as 20 GeV. 
%% \\
%% {\bf Jim, could you please check if 
%% $h_1$ as light as 20 GeV survives from the scan?

%% of $h_1$ defines its coupling to $a_1$
%% and the respective branching ratio $Br(h_1\to a1 a_1)$
%% as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{scomp13-vs-br-h-aa}
%% which presents singlet component of $h_1$
%% (mixing angle squared of the $h_1$ and the pure singlet state,

%% \end{center}

%% The essential parameter which controls  the $h_1$ to be a

%% $\kappa/\lambda$  
%% ({\bf I think we need a plot scomp(1,3)$^2$

%% Fig.~\ref{br-h-aa_vs_kap-lam}. One clearly see that for 
%% $\kappa/\lambda<0.3$, the $Br(h_1\to a1 a_1)$ is significant
%% which is related to the fact that the singlet component of
%% $h_1$ is large. One can see that the typical value of  
%% $Br(h_1\to a1 a_1)$ in this region is 70-100\%. 
%% ({\bf What are

%% The singlet and non-singlet 
%% features of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson, $h_1$,

%% \subsection{Production rates}

%% As we have shown,
%% the lightest CP-even Higgs boson, $h_1$,
%% typically has significant singlet component
%% in the region of our  interest 
%% (i.e. in the region of $m_{a1}<2 m_{\tau}$) 
%% and as we have found above,
%% both, $Br(h_1\to a_1 a_1)$  and $Br(a_1\to \mu\mu)$,
%% are quite significant. In the same time,
%% one should expect the suppression
%% of the $h_1$ production rate since $h_1$ interacts weakly with the 
%% fermions and gauge bosons  due to its  singlet nature.

%% In our study we have evaluated $pp\to h_1$ production cross section
%% for the $gg\to h_1$ and $b\bar{b}\to h_1$ process
%% at the next-to-leading order (NLO)
%% using the following 
%% procedure.

%% First, we have used  
%% HIGLU v2.102 package~\cite{Spira:1995rr} to calculate 
%% SM Higgs production cross section in $gg\to H_{SM}$ process.
%% Since the ratio of  $\sigma(gg\to h_1)/\sigma(gg\to H_{SM})$
%% production cross sections is equal to the ratio
%% of partial decay widths $\Gamma(h_1\to gg)/\Gamma(H_{SM}\to gg)$, one finds
%% \begin{equation}
%% \sigma(gg\to h_1)=\sigma(gg\to H_{SM})\frac{\Gamma(h_1\to gg)}{\Gamma(H_{SM}\to gg)}
%% =\sigma(gg\to H_{SM})\frac{Br(h_1\to gg)\Gamma^{tot}(h_1)}{\Gamma(H_{SM}\to gg)}.
%% \end{equation}
%% Therefore we have all components to evaluate $\sigma(gg\to h_1)$:
%% we use
%% $\sigma(gg\to H_{SM})$ and $\Gamma(H_{SM}\to gg)$ calculated  using HIGLU at  NLO,
%% while $Br(h_1\to gg)$ and $\Gamma^{tot}(h_1)$ we obtain using NMSSMtools.


%% \begin{figure}[htb]
%% \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{plots/cs3.eps}%
%% \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{plots/sig_vs_kaplam.eps}%
%% \caption{Combined 
%% $\sigma(gg\to {\cal H}) + \sigma(b\bar{b}\to {\cal H})$ production cross section
%% versus $m_{\cal H}$ for NMSSM and SM,
%% where ${\cal H}$ stands either for NMSSM or SM Higgs boson.
%% \label{cs3}}
%% \end{figure}

%% The cross section of $b\bar{b}\to h_1$ was also evaluated at
%% NLO as follows. The numerical calculation for the  SM Higgs
%% production in  $b\bar{b}\to H_{SM}$ fusion has been carried out
%% with the program developed in \cite{Balazs:1998sb} and lately
%% used also in \cite{Belyaev:2005nu} where the QCD-improved
%% (running) Yukawa couplings have been used. Then using
%% $Y_{bbh_1}/Y_{bbH_{SM}}$ ratio of  Yukawa couplings 
%% calculated  in NMSSMtools, one finds:
%% \begin{equation}
%% \sigma(b\bar{b}\to h_1)=\sigma(b\bar{b}\to H_{SM})
%% \left(\frac{Y_{bbh_1}}{Y_{bbH_{SM}}}\right)^2
%% \end{equation}
%% For the evaluation of production cross sections, CTEQ6M set for
%% parton density function set was used. 

%% Our first results  on the
%% combined  $\sigma(gg\to {\cal H}) + \sigma(b\bar{b}\to {\cal
%% H})$ production cross section versus $m_{\cal H}$ for NMSSM and
%% SM  are presented in Fig.\ref{cs3} (left), where ${\cal H}$ stands
%% either for NMSSM or SM Higgs boson. 
%% The right frame of Fig.\ref{cs3} 
%% presents $\sigma(gg\to {\cal H}) + \sigma(b\bar{b}\to {\cal
%% H})$ versus $\kappa/\lambda$ for NMSSM in more details. 
%% ({\bf Can we present(or
%% think about how to present) also results for $\sigma(gg\to
%% {\cal H})$ $\sigma(b\bar{b}\to {\cal H})$ separately to show
%% their relative contribution? }).
%% From Fig.~\ref{cs3} we can see that 
%% production cross section of NMSSM $h_1$ is indeed
%% suppressed typically by 2 orders of magnitude as compared to the
%% SM Higgs boson production in case when 
%% $h_1$ has a significant singlet component. The value of the
%% minimal suppression depends on the mass of $h_1$:
%% for $m_{h1}\simeq 40-50$ GeV, the maximal cross section of $h_1$
%% production is about 10 smaller than the SM one, while
%% when  $m_{h1}\simeq 115-125$ GeV its production cross section
%% is quite close to SM and can be as large as about 25 pb 
%% once the singlet component of $h_1$
%% vanishes.

%% Since we study the whole production and decay chain
%% $pp\to h_1 \to a_1 a_1\to 4\mu$ let us  look at the
%% cross section of the four-muon production after application
%% of the respective branching ratios from NMMStoos
%% to the $h_1$ production cross section which we have evaluated.

\subsection{Summary}
Existing data provides only partial constraints. Requirement of the model consistency with cosmoogical
data leads to XXX. Tevatron data allows constraining of the surviving fraction of the paramater space, 
but only weakly. Further exploration of this region cannot be done at Tevatron b/c that would require
a very significant increase in the size of the datasets. Conclusive exclusion or discovery of new physics
in this scenario would require a dedicated analysis performed at LHC. In the following, we describe such
analysis and discuss its sensitivity.


\section{Dedicated Search for NMSSM at LHC}

The main characteristic of the signal is two back-to-back di-muon pairs with pair consisting of 
spatially close muons. The di-muon pairs should have invariant masses consistent with each, which
serve as a measurement of $m_a$, and the four muon invariant mass distributionshould have a spike 
that corresponding to the $m_h$ mass. We use these striking features of signal events in designing 
the analysis with a reasonably high acceptance and very low backgrounds suitable for early LHC running.

\subsection{Production Mechanism and Cross Section Calculation}

The four muon final state considered in this analysis is experimentally a very clean signature 
with relatively low backgrounds. Therefore, instead of using the Vector Boson Fusion (VBF)
chosen in earlier NMSSM searches targeting the $m_a>2 m_\tau$ region, we focus on the largest 
Higgs production modes at the LHC, $gg \to h_1$ and $b\bar{b} \to h_1$.  To calculate NMSSM NLO 
cross-section for $pp \to h_1$ we follow the same procedure as for the Tevatron case based on
rescaling NLO calculations for $gg \to H_{SM}$~\cite{Spira:1995rr} and $bb \to H_{SM}$~\cite{Balazs:1998sb} 
to corrected for differences in couplings between SM and NMSSM:
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma(gg\to h_1)=\sigma(gg\to H_{SM})\frac{\Gamma(h_1\to gg)}{\Gamma(H_{SM}\to gg)} \\
=\sigma(gg\to H_{SM})\frac{Br(h_1\to gg)\Gamma^{tot}(h_1)}{\Gamma(H_{SM}\to gg)} \\
\sigma(b\bar{b}\to h_1)=\sigma(b\bar{b}\to H_{SM})
\left(\frac{Y_{bbh_1}}{Y_{bbH_{SM}}}\right)^2
\end{eqnarray}
where $\sigma(gg\to H_{SM})$ and $\Gamma(H_{SM}\to gg)$ is calculated using
HIGLU, while $Br(h_1\to gg)$, $\Gamma^{tot}(h_1)$, and the ratio of Yukawa couplings 
$Y_{bbh_1}/Y_{bbH_{SM}}$ are obtained using NMSSMTools.

Similar to the Tevatron case, the cross-section is strongly suppressed compared to SM if $h_1$ 
has a large singlet fraction. Figure~\ref{fig:sm_mukoverl2} shows the production cross-section for 14~TeV $pp \to h_1 X$ 
as a function of $\mu\kappa/\lambda$.  Note that the low $\mu\kappa/\lambda$ and low $\lambda$ 
region is excluded by WMAP, see Fig.~\ref{fig:darkmatter}-b. The non-excluded region have appreciable
production cross-section.

  \label{fig:sm_mukoverl2}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Analysis Selections}
We use Pythia to generate signal event templates with $m_h$ in the range from 70 to 140 GeV/c$^2$
and $m_a$  in the range from 0.5 to 4 GeV/c$^2$). For detector response emulation, we chose the CMS 
detector as a benchmark and used its parameters descibed in CMS Technical Design Report. The key 
parameters important for this analysis are muon momentum resolution, low threshold on muons to 
reach the muon system, acceptance and average muon reconstruction efficiencies. 

The analysis starts by requiring at least four muon candidates with $p_T>5$ \gevc in the fiducial 
volume of the detector $|\eta|<2.4$, of which at least one has to have $p_T>20$ $\gevc$ to suppress 
major backgrounds and to satisfy trigger requirements. Each event must have at least two muon 
candidates of positive and negative charge each. For surviving events, we define quadruplets of 
candidates consisting of two positive and two negatively charged muon candidates. Next, we sort the 
four muon candidates in quadruplet into two di-muon pairs by minimizing the quantity 
$(\Delta R(\mu_i,\mu_j)^2 + \Delta R (\mu_k,\mu_l)^2)$ under the constarint that each di-muon pair
consists of two muon candidates of opposite charge. Quadruplets in which $\Delta R$ between 
muons in any of the two pair exceeds 0.5 are discarded as inconsistent with signal topology. 
Acceptance of the selections listed above is shown in Table \ref{acceptance} and is large thanks to
the high coverage of the CMS muon system. Figures \ref{signal_acceptance}a) and 
\ref{signal_acceptance}b) illustrate the dependence of acceptance on values of $m_h$ and $m_a$. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.48\linewidth]{plots/acceptance_H.eps}
\includegraphics[width=0.48\linewidth]{plots/acceptance_a.eps}
\caption{Acceptance as a function of $m_a$ for fixed $m_h$. Acceptance as a function of $m_h$ for fixed $m_a$.}
\label{signal_acceptance}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


Requirement of four sufficiently energetic muons in the event drastically reduces contributions of 
potential backgrounds for this analysis. After acceptance selections, the dominant background is 
due to QCD multijet production where muons originate from either heavy flavor quark decays or from 
$K/\pi$ decays in flight. We use Pythia to estimate the QCD multijet background and we estimate it
at this stage to be approximately 2.6 events/pb$^-1$ (approximately half due to true muons and the 
rest from events with both prompt muons and muons from decays in flight). We also considered electroweak 
backgrounds estimated using CompHEP $pp \to 4l+X$ process to be 0.04 events/pb$^-1$ and direct J/psi 
production (Pythia), which was found to be completely negligible. Other SM backgrounds (top, W+jets) 
are negligible in the region of interest of this analysis.

The backgrounds are further reduced by applying kinematics requirements consistent
with the expected signal siganture. We calculate invariant mass of each of the di-muon pair, 
$m_{12} and m_{34}$, as well as the invariant mass of all four muons denoted as $M$. Figure 
\ref{muon_pairs_masses_invariant_mass}a) shows the invariant mass of the muon pairs passing 
all selections in signal events for two choices of $m_h$ and $m_a$. Figure \ref{muon_pairs_masses_invariant_mass}b) 
shows the distribution of the invariant mass $M$ of the four muon system for two benchmark points. 
To focus on the region of interest, we require $M>60$ \gevcc, $m_{12} < 4$, $m_{34} < 4$, which
reduces QCD background to 0.4 events/pb$^-1$. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.48\linewidth]{plots/muon_pairs_masses.eps}
\includegraphics[width=0.48\linewidth]{plots/invariant_mass.eps}
\caption{Left: Reconstructed invariant mass of reconstructed muon pairs for $m_a=0.5$ and 
3 GeV/c$^2$ (in both cases $m_H$ = 100 GeV/c$^2$). Right: Reconstructed invariant of four muons for 
$m_H=80$ and $m_H=120$ GeV/c$^2$ (in both cases $m_a$ = 3.0 GeV).}
\label{muon_pairs_masses_invariant_mass}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The next logical requirement would be $|m_{12}-m_{34}|<0.08+0.005*(m_{12}+m_{34})$.  This cut is
enforcing the requirement that the two pair masses are consistent with each other and 
takes into account widening of the absolute resolution in the reconstructed di-muon
mass as a function of mass (Figure \ref{muon_pairs_masses_diff} shows the difference in the 
reconstructed masses of the two di-muon pairs in signal events, which determines the
size of the signal region  in the ($m_{12}, m_{34}$) plane). After applying these cuts, 
the only background that may be not completely negligible is QCD multi-jet, for which we 
conservatively estimate the upper bound to be 0.02 events/pb$^-1$. Instead of applying this 
cut explicitly, a better approach is a fit in the 3D space of 
measured values of $(m_{12},m_{34}, m_{1234})$ taking into account
kinematical properties of  signal events. This approach allows maximizing signal
acceptance and therefore statistical power of the analysis and is discussed in what
follows. It is also convenient from experimental point of view as the backgrounds
will  be distributed in some smooth fashion over the 3D space allowing fitting the 3D
distribution to estimate  backgrounds directly from the data. Potential signal would
appear as a concentration of events in one specific  region in the 3D space (a 3D
``bump''). We use a binned likelihood defined as a function of parameters $m_a$, 
$m_h$ and effective signal cross section $\sigma \times B (h \to aa) B^2(a \to mu \mu)$. 
Thus defined likelihood is used to fit pseudodata generated using either background or 
signal+background templates. We use Bayesian statistics to estimate sensitivity of the 
proposed analysis and present it in terms of the 95\% C.L. exclusion levels for signal 
cross-section.

If necessary, further large background suppression can be obtained by adding the isolation requirement 
to one or both di-muon pairs in the event, e.g. by setting the upper bound on the sum of transverse momenta 
of all tracks in a cone around the reconstructed direction of the di-muon pair excluding momenta of the 
two muon tracks. Such requirement can allow a very substantial suppression of the dominant source of the background coming from events with one or more 
muons originating from jets. We choose not to use this critirea as our estimates show that the final rate 
of such background events is already very low. If data shows larger contribution of these events, 
this isolation requirement would allow bringing backgrounds back to very low level at a moderate
cost to signal acceptance.

\subsection{Results}
We calculate the 95\% C.L.\ upper limit on the product $\sigma(pp \to h) B_{h \to aa} B^2_{a \to \mu \mu} \, \alpha$, 
using Bayesian technique which is 0.0293~pb at $L = 100$~pb$^{-1}$, approximately 3 events.  In vast majority of 
pseudoexperiments, this limit is independent of $m_h$ and $m_a$ because the effective signal region that dominates 
signal significance in the fitter is essentially background free and probability to observe any pseudodata event is 
very small. Since $B_{a \to \mu\mu}$ is nearly a function of $m_a$ only, it can be factored out, and the corresponding 
upper limit on $\sigma(pp \to h) B_{h \to aa} \alpha$ is presented in Table~\ref{table_bramumu_factorized}.  The upper 
limit on $\sigma(pp \to h) B_{h \to aa}$ is shown as a function of $m_h$ and $m_a$ in Table~\ref{table_both_factorized} 
by factoring out $\alpha$ as well.  Keep in mind that $B_{h \to aa}$ is close to 100\% in much of our preferred region 
of NMSSM parameter space.
