cs^NMSSM(gg -> h1 -> a1 a1 -> 4mu)
and
cs^NMSSM(bb->h1 -> a1 a1 -> 4mu)


to calculate these CS we need
to use the following parameters from the NMSSM scan
(so whoever is scanning, please save these pars for every scanned point)

BRJJ(1)    which is Br(h1->gg)
WIDTH(1)   which is Gamma_tot  of h1
BRHAA(1,1) which is Br(h1->a1 a1)
BRMM(4)    which is Br(a1-> mu mu)
CD(1)      which is thre reduced bbh1 coupling G^NMSSM(bbh1)

more details about these pars are in nmspec.f file
Using these pars we will calculate the cs we need:

1)
   a)
   cs^NMSSM(gg->h1)  =  cs^SM(gg->H)*Gamma^NMSSM(ggh1)/Gamma^SM(ggH)
   
  = cs^SM(gg->H)*BRJJ(1)*WIDTH(1)/Gamma^SM(ggH)

   where Gamma^SM(ggH) and  cs^SM(gg->H) will be provided by me as a
   tabulated functions of the Higgs mass

so,
    b) cs^NMSSM(gg -> h1 -> a1 a1 -> 4mu)
      = cs^NMSSM(gg->h1)*BRHAA(1,1)*BRMM(4)^2

3) now we need to calculate
   cs^NMSSM(bb->h1 -> a1 a1 -> 4mu)

   in analogy with 1), we have

   a)
   cs^NMSSM(bb->h1)  =  cs^SM(bb->H)*G^NMSSM(bbh1)^2 = cs^SM(bb->H)*CD1^2
   where cs^SM(bb->H) will be provided by me as a 
   tabulated functions of the Higgs mass

   b) so
    cs^NMSSM(bb -> h1 -> a1 a1 -> 4mu) = cs^SM(bb->H)*CD1^2*BRHAA(1,1)*BRMM(4)^2


This is basically it. So, from now please keep saving mentioned above pars
BRJJ(1)    which is Br(h1->gg)
WIDTH(1)   which is Gamma_tot  of h1
BRHAA(1,1) which is Br(h1->a1 a1)
BRMM(4)    which is Br(a1-> mu mu)
CD(1)      which is thre reduced bbh1 coupling G^NMSSM(bbh1)

I will send you tabulated functions shortly.

Let me know if you have any questions, please.

Cheers,
        Sasha
